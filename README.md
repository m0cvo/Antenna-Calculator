# Antenna-Calculator
Web API written in Blazor (ASP.Net Core)

Following on from the various desktop antenna calculators I have written using C# - Winforms, WPF and UWP - this is the first one I have written using Blazor to enable Web access.
The desktop apps are all available from the Microsoft Store but I am hoping to make this one available for free online once I have tidied it up a bit.
